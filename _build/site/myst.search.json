This property is equivalent to the Axiom of Choice and therefore has a somewhat dubious ontological status among mathematicians.\n\nA choice function for a set X is a function f that assigns every set Y \\in X an element y \\in Y.:icon: false\n\n**(AC)** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every set $X$ of non-empty sets has a choice function.\n\nThe Axiom of Choice allows for enumerating a (non-empty) set A by using  a choice function for all non-empty subsets of A. If the set of elements of A not yet enumerated is non-empty, the choice function applied to this set will give us the next element to be enumerated (thereby well-ordering A). On the other hand, if A is well-ordered, we can obtain a choice function by mapping a non-empty subset of A to its least element under the well-ordering.\n\nIt follows that the Axiom of Choice is equivalent to Zermelo’s Well-Ordering Principle:\n\nWell-Ordering Principle (\\WO)\n\nEvery set can be well-ordered\n\nBesides \\WO, \\AC has applications in pretty much any branch of mathematics, with many equivalent principles (such Zorn’s Lemma, ), but also some strange consequences (such as the Banach-Tarski Paradox).\n\nThe foundational issue with the Axiom of Choice lies primarily in the fact that it postulates the existence of a function without any giving any hint at how such a function might be defined. For some sets (e.g., the rationals) we can explicitly describe a well-ordering (by identifying \\Q with a subset of \\Z\\times \\Nat and then well-ordering that). But \\AC also guarantees a well-order of the reals, and if you try to ‘write down’ such a well-order, you will quickly run into difficulties.\n\nWe will need the Axiom of Choice in many places. In the next section, we will use it to develop the theory of cardinal numbers.

Wir werden das Auswahlaxiom an vielen Stellen, zun�chst vor allem in der Theorie der Kardinalzahlen, ben�tigen, sp�ter Anwendungen in der Deskriptiven Mengenlehre darstellen.

That means one can build up the Borel sets from the open sets by iterating the operations of complementation and countable union. This generates sets that are more and more complicated, which is reflected in the Borel hierarchy. The complexity is reflected on the logical side by the number of quantifier changes needed to define the set. There is a close connection between the arithmetical hierarchy in computability and the Borel hierarchy.\n\nLet X be a set. A σ-algebra \\mathcal{S} on X is a collection of subsets of X such that \\mathcal{S} is closed under complements and countable unions, that is\n\nif A \\in \\mathcal{S}, then X \\setminus A \\in \\mathcal{S}, and\n\nif (A_n)_{n \\in \\Nat} is a sequence of sets in \\mathcal{S}, then \\bigcup_n A_n \\in \\mathcal{S},\n\nIf the enveloping space X is clear, we use \\Co{A} to denote the complement of A in X.\n\nIt is easy to derive that a σ-algebra is also closed under the following set-theoretic operations:\n\ncountable intersections -- we have \\bigcap A_n = \\Co{\\bigcup_n \\Co{A_n}}.\n\ndifferences -- we have A \\setminus B = A \\cap \\Co{B}.\n\nSymmetric differences -- we have A \\bigtriangleup B = (A \\cap \\Co{B}) \\cup (\\Co{A} \\cap B).\n\nLet (X,\\mathcal{O}) be a topological space. The collection of Borel sets in X is the smallest σ-algebra containing the open sets in \\mathcal{O}.\n\nOf course, one has to make sure that this collection actually exists. For this, note that the intersection of any collection of σ-algebras is again a σ-algebra, so the Borel sets are just the intersection of all σ-algebras containing \\mathcal{O}. (Note the the full power set of X is such a σ-algebras, so we are not taking an empty intersection.)\n\nThe definition of Borel sets is rather “external”. It does not give us much of an idea what Borel sets look like. One can arrive at the family of Borel sets also through a construction from “within”. This reveals more structure and gives rise to the Borel hierarchy.","type":"content","url":"/borel","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Borel Sets","lvl2":"The Borel hierarchy"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/borel#the-borel-hierarchy","position":2},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Borel Sets","lvl2":"The Borel hierarchy"},"content":" \n```{admonition} Exercise\n:class: tip\n\nShow that in a Polish space, every closed set is a countable intersection of open sets.\n``` \n\n\nTo generate the Borel sets, we start with the open sets. By closing under complements, we obtain the closed sets. We also have to close under countable unions. The open sets are already closed under this operation, but the closed sets are not.\n\nCountable unions of closed sets are classically known as F_\\sigma sets. Their complements, i.e. countable intersections of open sets, are the G_\\delta sets.\n\nWe can continue this way and form the F_{\\sigma\\delta} sets -- countable intersections of F_\\sigma sets -- the G_{\\delta\\sigma} sets -- countable unions of G_\\delta sets -- and so on.\n\nThe \\sigma\\delta-notation soon becomes rather impractical, and hence we replace it by something more convenient, and much more suggestive, as we will see later.\n\nTo make the hierarchy that we are introducing well-behaved, we focus on metrizable spaces.\n\nLet X be a metrizable topological space. We inductively define the following collection of subsets of X.\\begin{align*}\n    & \\bSigma^0_1(X) = \\{ U \\colon U\\subseteq X \\text{ open } \\} \\\\\n    & \\bPi^0_n(X) = \\{ \\Co{A} \\colon A \\in \\bSigma^0_n(X) \\} = \\Co{\\bSigma^0_n(X)} \\\\\n    & \\bSigma^0_{n+1}(X) = \\{ \\bigcup_k A_k \\colon A_k \\in \\bPi^0_n(X) \\} \n\\end{align*}\n\nHence the open sets are precisely the sets in \\bSigma^0_1, the closed sets are the sets in \\bPi^0_1, the F_\\sigma sets from the class \\bSigma^0_2 etc. If it is clear what the underlying space X is, we drop the reference to it and simply write \\bSigma^0_n and \\bPi^0_n. Besides, we will say that a set A \\subseteq X is (or is not) \\bSigma^0_n or \\bPi^0_n, respectively.\n\nQuestion: Does the collection of all \\bSigma^0_n and \\bPi^0_n exhaust the Borel sets of X?\n\nWe will see that the answer is no.

The complements of such sets then provide examples of \\bPi^0_2 sets that are neither open nor closed, showing that the first two levels of the Borel hierarchy are proper for perfect Polish spaces.\n\nUsing the concept of Baire category, we will later show that the rationals \\mathbb{Q} are \\bSigma^0_2 but not \\bPi^0_2, thereby separating \\bSigma^0_2 and \\bPi^0_2.\n\nIt is much harder to find specific examples for the higher levels, e.g. a \\bSigma^0_5 set that is not \\bSigma^0_4. This separation will be much facilitated by the introduction of a definability framework for the Borel sets.

Hence such a function cannot exist.\n\nWe finish this lecture by showing that Young’s Theorem can be reversed.\n\nGiven a \\bPi^0_2 subset A of a perfect Polish space X, there exists a mapping f: X \\to \\Real such that f is continuous at every point in A, and discontinuous at every other point, i.e. C_f = A.\n\nFix a countable dense subset D  \\subseteq X.\nWe first deal with the easier case that A is open.

We now form the seriesf(x) = \\sum_n b_n f_n(x).\n\nSince |f_n(x)| \\leq 1, |f(x)| \\leq \\sum_n b_n < \\infty. Furthermore, (f_n) converges uniformly to f, for|f(x) - f_n(x)| \\leq \\sum_{k > n} b_k < b_n,\n\nand the last bound is independent of x and converges to 0.\n\nIt follows by uniform convergence that if each f_n is continuous at x, f is continuous on x, too. Hence f is continuous on A.\n\nNow assume x \\not\\in A. Then there exist n such that x \\in G_n \\setminus G_{n+1}. Hencef_0(x) = \\dots = f_n(x) = 0.\n\nAgain, we distinguish two cases.\n\nFirst, assume x \\not\\in \\Cl{G_{n+1}}. Then there exists \\delta > 0 such that U_\\delta(x) \\subseteq \\Co{G_{n+1}}. This also implies  U_\\delta(x) \\subseteq \\Co{G_{k}} for any k \\geq n+1. Besides, since G_n is open, we can chose δ sufficiently small so that U_\\delta(x) \\subseteq G_n. For y \\in \\Co{D} \\cap U_\\delta(x) we have f_k(y) = 1 for all k \\geq n+1, and hence f(y) = \\sum_{k > n} b_k f_k(y) > 0. On the other hand, if y \\in D \\cap U_\\delta(x), then f_k(y) = 0 for all k \\geq n+1, and also f_0(y) = \\dots = f_n(y) = 0, since y \\in G_n, and thus f(y) = 0. Hence there are points arbitrarily close to x whose f-values differ by a constant lower bound, which implies f is not continuous in x.\n\nFinally, suppose x \\in \\Cl{G_{n+1}}. Then f_{n+1}(x) = 1 and hence f(x) \\geq b_{n+1} > 0. On the other hand, for any y \\in G_{n+1}, f(y) \\leq \\sum_{k> n+1} b_k < b_{n+1} = f(x). That is, there are points arbitrarily close to x whose f-value differs from f(x) by a constant lower bound.

(Why?)\n\nSeparation allows us to select from any class \\{x \\colon \\varphi(x,\\ldots)\\} those elements that are in a given set a and collect them in a set\\{x \\in a \\colon \\varphi(x,\\ldots)\\}\n\nNext, we have\n\n(Pairing)  \\qquad \\exists y \\forall x( x \\in y \\leftrightarrow  x = a \\vee x = b).\n\nThis axioms allows forming pairs of sets, specifically\\begin{align*}\n    \\{a,b\\} & : =  \\{x\\colon x=a \\; \\vee \\; x=b \\} &    \\\\\n    \\{a\\} &: = \\{x\\colon x=a  \\} &    \\text{singleton set}\\\\\n    (a,b) &: =  \\{\\{a\\},\\{a,b\\}\\} &    \\text{ordered pair}\n\\end{align*}\n\nWhile for the pair set \\{a,b\\} = \\{b,a\\} the order is not important, we have for the ordered pair(a,b) = (c,d) \\leftrightarrow a = c \\wedge b = d.\n\nHence, we can introduce binary relations as classes of ordered pairs\\begin{gather*}\n    \\Op{Rel}(R) :\\leftrightarrow  \\forall u \\in R \\; \\exists x,y  \\; (u =(x,y)).\n\\end{gather*}\n\nAs usual, by identifying functions with their graphs, we can introduce functions as a special kind of relation:\\begin{gather*}\nF: A \\to B :\\leftrightarrow  \\forall x \\in A \\; \\exists ! y \\in B \\; (x,y) \\in F.\n\\end{gather*}\n\nWe write \\Op{Fun}(a) to denote that fact that a is a function.\n\nFurther elementary axioms:\n\n(Union)   \\qquad \\forall a \\exists y \\forall z (z \\in y  \\leftrightarrow  \\exists x \\in a \\; z \\in x)\n\nNote that Replacement is an axiom scheme: For any formula, if that formula defines a function F, it asserts the existence of a set (the image set).\n\n(Replacement)F \n\\qquad \\forall a  ((F: a \\to \\mathbf{V}) \\: \\rightarrow \\: \\exists u \\forall y (y \\in u \\leftrightarrow \\exists x \\in a \\; y = F(x)))\n\n(Power Set) \\qquad \\forall a \\exists y \\forall z (z \\in y \\leftrightarrow z \\subseteq a)\n\nIt follows that, for a given set a, the following classes are sets:\\begin{align*}\n\\bigcup \\, a = \\bigcup_{x \\in a} x & : = \\{z \\colon \\exists x \\in a \\; z \\in x \\}  &  \\qquad  \\text{union}\\\\\nF[a] = \\{F(x)|x \\in a\\} &: = \\{y\\colon \\exists x \\in a \\; y = F(x) \\}  &  \\qquad  \\text{image set}\\\\\n\\mathcal{P}(a) &: = \\{x\\colon x \\subseteq a\\} & \\qquad  \\text{power set}\n\\end{align*}\n\n(Infinity)  \\qquad \\exists x ( \\emptyset \\in x \\wedge \\forall y ( y \\in x \\to y \\cup \\{y\\} \\in x))\n\nThe axiom of Infinity is a “pure” set existence axiom, that is, it does not depend on another set already existing. It therefore renders the axiom of Set Existence above redundant.\nIt also implies the existence of the set \\Nat of natural numbers (along with the operation +), which we will address in more detail below.\n\nUsing \\Nat, we can introduce the other basic number sets:\n\n\\Integer = (\\Nat\\times\\Nat)/ \\sim_\\Integer, where (x,y) \\sim_\\Integer (u,v) :\\Leftrightarrow  x+v = y+u. Multiplication on \\Integer can be defined inductively (see below).\n\n\\Rat = (\\Integer\\times\\Integer)/\\sim_\\Rat, where (x,y) \\sim_\\Rat (u,v) :\\Leftrightarrow xv = yu.\n\nWe can extend the linear order < of \\Nat to \\Integer and then to \\Rat in the usual way. Then we can introduce the real numbers as the set of Dedekind cuts:\\Real = \\{ x \\in \\mathcal{P}(\\Rat) \\colon x \\neq \\emptyset \\: \\wedge \\: x \\neq \\Rat \\: \\wedge \\: \\forall z \\in x \\forall y \\in \\Rat \\: y < z \\to y \\in x \\}.\n\nThe final axiom of \\ZF is\n\n(Foundation) \\qquad \\forall a \\;( a \\neq \\emptyset \\to \\exists x \\in a \\; \\forall y \\in x \\, y \\not \\in a).\n\nFoundation rules out, for example, that a set can be an element of itself. More precisely, the axiom states that \\in-relation is well-founded on any set.\n\nWe can also formalize the Axiom of Choice:\n\n(Choice) \\qquad \\forall a ( \\forall x \\in a \\; x \\neq \\emptyset \\;\\;\\; \\to \\;\\;\\; \\exists f (\\Op{Fun}(f) \\:\\wedge\\: \\Op{dom}(f) = a \\:\\wedge\\: \\forall x \\in a \\: f(x) \\in x))\n\nWe denote the axiom system \\ZF + \\AC as \\ZFC -- Zermelo-Fraenkel with Choice.","type":"content","url":"/zfc#the-axioms-of-mathsf-zfc","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Analytic Sets"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/analytic","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Analytic Sets"},"content":"A subset A of a Polish space X is analytic if it is empty or there exists a continuous function f:\\Baire \\to X such that f(\\Baire) = A.\n\nWe will later see that the analytic sets correspond to the sets definable by means of \\Sigma^1_1 formulas, that is formulas in the language of second order arithmetic that have one existential function quantifier.\n\nTherefore, we will denote the analytic subsets of X also by\\PS{1}(X).\n\nHere are some simple properties of analytic sets.\n\n(i) Every Borel set is analytic.\n\n(ii) A continuous image of analytic set is analytic.\n\n(iii) Countable unions of analytic sets are analytic.\n\n(i): This follows directly from \n\nCorollary 1.\n\n(ii): The composition of continuous mappings is continuous.\n\n(iii): Let A_n be analytic and f_n:\\Baire \\to X such that f_n(\\Baire) = A_n.

It has consequences that seem paradoxical in the sense that they conflict with basic intuitions we have about objects and they behavior with respect to size or other characteristics. Arguably the most famous example is the Banach-Tarski Paradox, which uses the Axiom of Choice to partition a ball in \\Real^3 into finitely many pieces, and then, using rigid transformations (i.e.\\ rotations and translations), to assemble them into two balls of the original size.\n\nOn the other hand, the Axiom of Choice implies or is even equivalent to many principles that are applied throughout many areas of mathematics, such as the existence of bases of vector spaces, Zorn’s Lemma, Tychonoff’s Theorem on the compactness of product spaces, the Hahn-Banach Theorem, or the Prime Ideal Theorem.\n\nFor some applications, however, a weaker form of the Axiom of Choice is sufficient.\n\nThe Axiom of Countable Choice:\n\n(ACω)     Every countable family \\mathcal{X} of non-empty sets has a choice-function.\n\nStronger than Countable Choice, but still weaker than the full Axiom of Choice is  Axiom of Dependent Choice:\n\n(DC)     If E is a binary relation on a non-empty set A, and if for every a \\in A there exists b \\in A such that a \\: E\\: b, then there exists a function f:\\Nat \\to A such that for all n \\in \\Nat, f(n) \\: E \\: f(n+1).\n\nA seminal result by \n\nSolovay (1970) showed that DC is no longer sufficient to prove the existence of non-regular sets in the above sense.

A Borel set can have (and has) multiple codes, just as it has multiple representations. We can, for example, represent an open set by different sets W of initial segments.\n\nMoreover, every \\bSigma^0_1 set is also \\bSigma^0_2, and thus a set has codes which reflect the ``more complicated’’ definition of the \\bSigma^0_1 set as a union of closed sets. It is useful to keep this distinction between a Borel set and its Borel representation in mind.\n\nThe following is a straightforward induction.\n\nEvery \\bSigma^0_n (\\bPi^0_n) set has a \\bSigma^0_n (\\bPi^0_n) Borel code, and every \\bSigma^0_n (\\bPi^0_n) code represents a \\bSigma^0_n (\\bPi^0_n) set. The proposition actually holds for *all* Borel sets, which can be proved by **transfinite induction**. However, we have not introduced Borel sets of transfinite order yet, so we state the existence of codes only for $\\bPi^0_n$ ($\\bSigma^0_n$) sets. In the next chapter, we will study the *full* Borel hierarchy, and then it should be clear that the above proposition extends to all Borel sets.   ## The tree structure of Borel codes\n\nEach Borel code induces a tree structure that reflects how the corresponding Borel set is built up from closed sets.\nThe terminal nodes are given by codes for closed sets (the ones starting with \"$2$\"), since they are the ``building blocks'' of the Borel sets and hence are not extend/split further. A \"$3$-code\" represents a node  with just one immediate successor, while a \"$4$-code\" corresponds to a node with infinitely many immediate successors. Given a Borel code $\\gamma$, we **denote the corresponding tree by $T_\\gamma$**.\n\nThe tree of a Borel code defined this way **is always well-founded** (i.e. has no infinite path), since a Borel code is defined via a well-founded recursion. The rank of the tree is a countable ordinal. \n\nHow hard is it to decide whether a given real is a Borel code? We will see later that this question is quite difficult. More precisely, we will see that the **set $\\Op{Bc}$ of all Borel codes is not Borel**. Deciding whether a tree on $\\Nat$ is well-founded will play a fundamental role in this regard.\n\nThe tree structure of a code also lets us assign levels to a Borel code similar to the levels of the Borel hierarchy:\n\n- Trees with a single node $(2)$ correspond to **$\\bPi^0_1$ codes**. \n- If $T$ is a $\\bPi^0_n$ ($\\bSigma^0_n$) code, then the tree with new top node $(3)$ represents a $\\bSigma^0_n$ ($\\bPi^0_n$) code. \n- And if $T_n$ is a sequence of $\\bPi^0_n$ codes, then the tree with new top node $(4)$ and each $T_n$ directly below it corresponds to a **$\\bSigma^0_{n+1}$ code**.\n ","type":"content","url":"/codingborel#borel-codes-of-finite-order","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Coding Borel Sets","lvl2":"Computing with Borel codes"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/codingborel#computing-with-borel-codes","position":6},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Coding Borel Sets","lvl2":"Computing with Borel codes"},"content":"Suppose γ is a computable code for an F_\\sigma set B.

It reflects that the sets in a filter share some largeness property.\n\nA non-empty family \\mathcal{F} \\subseteq \\Pow(X) of subsets of a given set X is a filter if\\begin{align*}\n(\\Op{F1}) & \\qquad A \\in \\mathcal{F} \\text{ and } B \\supseteq A \\text{ implies } B \\in \\mathcal{F},\\\\\n(\\Op{F2}) & \\qquad A, B \\in \\mathcal{F}  \\text{ implies } A \\cap B \\in\\mathcal{F}.\n\\end{align*}\n\nAgain, closure under countable intersections yields σ-filters.\n\nIf \\mathcal{I} is a (σ-) ideal, then \\mathcal{F} = \\{\\Co{A} \\colon A \\in \\mathcal{I}\\} is a (σ-) filter. Hence the co-finite subsets of \\Real form a filter, and the co-countable subsets form a σ-filter.\n\nNote that the complement of a (σ-) ideal (in \\Pow(X)) is not necessarily a (σ-) filter. This is true, however, for a special class of ideals/filters.\n\nA non-empty family \\mathcal{I} \\subseteq \\Pow(X) is a prime ideal if it is an ideal for which\n\nfor every A \\in X, either A\\in \\mathcal{I} or \\Co{A} \\in \\mathcal{I} (but not both).\n\nAn ultrafilter is a filter whose complement in \\Pow(X) is a prime ideal.\n\nIn light of the small-/largeness motivation, prime ideals and ultrafilters provide a complete separation of X: Each set is either small or large.","type":"content","url":"/measure#filters-and-ideals","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Measure and Baire Category","lvl2":"Measures"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/measure#measures","position":4},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Measure and Baire Category","lvl2":"Measures"},"content":"Coarsely speaking, a measure assigns a size to a set in a way that reflects our basic geometric intuition about sizes: The size of the union of disjoint objects is the sum of their sizes. The question whether this can be done in a consistent way for all subsets of a given space is of fundamental importance and has motivated many questions in set theory.\n\nThe formally, a measure μ on X is a [0,\\infty]-valued function defined on subsets of X that satisfies\\begin{align*}\n    (\\Op{M1}) & \\qquad \\mu(\\emptyset) = 0 \\\\\n    (\\Op{M2}) & \\qquad \\mu(\\bigcup_n A_n) = \\sum_n \\mu(A_n), \\\\\n              & \\qquad \\qquad \\text{whenever the $A_n$ are pairwise disjoint.}\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe question is, of course, which subsets of X can be assigned a measure. The condition (M2) suggests that this family is closed under countable unions. Furthermore, if A \\subseteq X, then the equation \\mu(X) = \\mu(A) + \\mu(\\Co{A}) suggests that \\Co{A} should be measurable, too. In other words, the sets who are assigned a measure form a σ-algebra.\n\nA measurable space is a pair (X, \\mathcal{S}), where X is a set and \\mathcal{S} is a σ-algebra on X. A measure on a measurable space (X, \\mathcal{S}) is a function \\mu: \\mathcal{S} \\to [0,\\infty] that satisfies (M1) and (M2) for any pairwise disjoint family \\{A_n\\} in \\mathcal{S}. If μ is a measure on (X, \\mathcal{S}), then the triple (X,\\mathcal{S}, \\mu) is called a measure space.\n\nIf we want the measure μ to reflect also some other basic intuition about geometric sizes, this often puts restrictions on the σ-algebra of measurable sets. For example, in \\Real the measure of an interval should be its length. We will see later that, if we assume the Axiom of Choice, it is impossible to assign every subset of \\Real a measure, so that (M1) and (M2) are satisfied, and the measure of an interval is its length.\n\nTo have some control over what the σ-algebra of measurable sets should be, one can construct a measure more carefully, start with a measure on basic objects such as intervals or balls, and then extend it to larger classes of sets by approximation.\n\nAn essential component in this extension process is the concept of an outer measure.\n\nAn outer measure on a set X is a function \\mu^*: \\Pow(X) \\to [0,\\infty] such that\\begin{align*}\n    (\\Op{O1}) & \\qquad  \\mu^*(\\emptyset) = 0,\\\\\n    (\\Op{O2}) & \\qquad  A \\subseteq B \\text{ implies } \\mu^*(A) \\leq \\mu^*(B), \\\\\n    (\\Op{O3}) & \\qquad  \\mu^*(\\bigcup_n A_n) \\leq \\sum_n \\mu^*(A_n), \\\\\n         & \\qquad  \\qquad \\text{for any countable family  $\\{A_n\\}$ in $X$}.\n\\end{align*}\n\nAn outer measure hence weakens the conditions of additivity (M2) to subadditivity (O3). This makes it possible to have non-trivial outer measures that are defined on all subsets of X.\n\nThe usefulness of outer measures lies in the fact that they can always be restricted to subset of \\Pow(X) on which they behave as measures.\n\nLet \\mu^* be an outer measure on X. A set A \\subseteq X is \\mu^*-measurable if\\mu^*(B) = \\mu^*(B \\cap A) + \\mu^*(B \\setminus A) \\quad \\text{ for all $B \\subseteq X$}.\n\nThis definition is justified rather by its consequences than by its intuitive appeal. Regarding the latter, suffice it to say here that outer measures may be rather far from being even finitely additive. The definition singles out those sets that split all other sets correctly, with regard to measure.\n\nThe class of \\mu^*-measurable sets forms a σ-algebra \\mathcal{M}, and the restriction of \\mu^* to \\mathcal{M} is a measure.\n\nA proof can be found in any standard book on measure theory, for instance \n\nHalmos (1950) or \n\nRoyden & Fitzpatrick (1988).\n\nThe size of the σ-algebra of measurable sets depends, of course, on the outer measure \\mu^*.

Instead, we developed a formal theory of axioms for a binary relation that somehow describe “how sets work”, that is, how we can obtain sets from given ones using well-known operations like power set and union.\n\nWe have then seen how we can develop a lot of standard mathematical objects (like \\Nat, \\Real) and techniques (like induction and definition by recursion) inside this formal system. In fact, most of mathematics can be developed formally inside this system. Almost all proofs you find in any standard math book are proofs that can be formalized in \\ZFC. It is very tedious to do this for us humans, but there is little doubt it can be done, and in fact, looking at the recent work on proof assistants (like Coq or Lean), many parts of mathematics have been formalized (albeit not directly in \\ZFC).\n\nThis expressiveness gives \\ZFC its foundational importance, but it is also the cause for much confusion for someone who first studies set theory.\n\nFrom a pedagogical point of view, in what follows it is helpful to assume a “Platonist” perspective of mathematics, and set theory in particular, namely that sets and the relations between exist independently (and outside) of the \\ZFC axioms. The set of real numbers exists, and our development of \\Real inside \\ZFC is just a formal way to describe them. From this perspective, the axioms of \\ZF (\\AC is a little different) are just obvious truths about sets, just like the Peano axioms are obvious truths about natural numbers.\n\nAmong other things, this perspective allows us to treat \\ZF just like any other mathematical theory, like group theory or the theory of algebraically closed fields.\nIn particular, we can think about models of set theory the way we would think about models of group theory, in the sense of model theory.\n\nA model would simply be a set M together with a binary relation E on S such that(M,E) \\models \\ZF,\n\nthat is, all axioms hold when interpreted in (M,E). Note that we use “set” in this context not in the formal sense, but in the “meta”-sense (the Platonist world of sets).\n\nWorking in the meta-theory (“that what is mathematically true”), we know by Gödel’s completeness theorem that\n\nif \\ZF is consistent, then it has a model.\n\nThis model should be seen as a set-theoretic universe: Its elements can be seen as sets, and the interpretation  E of the \\in-symbol will tell us how these sets are connected via the element-relation.\n\nNote that E does not have to be the actual element relation on a set (of sets), but just some binary relation so that the axioms are satisfied.\n\nIn the meta-world, there are, of course, sets other than M, but that does not matter here, since al we are interested in is giving some universe in which our axioms hold. (Timothy Chow has suggested that set theory should rather be called \"universe theory. He is right in the sense that what axiomatic set theory does is to define such universes of sets, rather than what a set is.)\n\nIn the meta-theory, we can then follow the usual techniques to show provability or non-provability results.\n\nIf we want to prove that \\CH is consistent with \\ZF (assuming \\ZF is consistent), we need to find a model in which both hold.\n\nOne difficulty in working with models of set theory is that they can look very different depending on whether you look at a model “from the inside” or “from the outside”.\n\nTo illustrate this, assume \\ZF is consistent. Then, by the Löwenheim-Skolem theorem, there exists a countable model for \\ZF.\nYet it is a theorem of \\ZF that there exists an uncountable set. This is often referred to as Skolem’s paradox, although it is not really an antinomy.\n\nIf we break this down a bit, we see that the apparent paradox is really just a matter of perspective (inside or outside). Assume (M,E) is a countable model of \\ZF. Then there exists x \\in M such that there is no injection from x to the natural numbers. Since M is countable, x can have at most countably many elements. So why is this not a contradiction? We should really read the statement above as\n\nthere is no injection in M from x to M’s version of the natural numbers.\n\nIn other words, even though x is countable from the outside, x appears uncountable inside M since a mapping witnessing its countability does not exist in M.\n\nThis is a first warning sign that models of \\ZF can behave in very unexpected ways. For another example, recall the axiom of Foundation asserts that the \\in-relation is well-founded. But again, this means only “from the inside”.\n\nIf \\ZF is consistent, than there exists a model (M,E) of \\ZF such that (M,E) is ill-founded.\n\nIntroduce new constant symbols c_n (n \\in \\Nat) and add the formulas \\varphi_n \\equiv c_{n+1} \\in c_n to the axioms of \\ZF.

The \n\nSchröder-Bernstein Theorem (for a proof see e.g. \n\nJech (2003)) implies that |P| = |\\R|.\n\nTo construct the desired injection, choose x \\in P and let \\eps_0 = 1 = 2^0.

Since a \\in \\Op{TC}_R(x), b \\in \\Op{TC}_R(x), and therefore b \\in C, contradicting the minimality of a.\n\nThe lemma implies a corresponding induction principle for well-founded relations:(\\Op{Ind}_R) \\qquad  \\forall x \\in A [ \\forall y ( yRx \\, \\to \\varphi(y)) \\to \\varphi(x)] \\to \\forall x \\in A \\, \\varphi(x)).\n\nThis in turn yields the following.\n\nRecursion principle for well-founded relations\n\nLet R be a well-founded relation on a class A.

Thus, by Shoenfield’s Representation Theorem relativized to M, A^M(\\alpha).\n\nAbsoluteness for \\Pi^1_2 follows by employing the same reasoning, using that the complement is \\Sigma^1_2.\n\nBy analyzing the proof one sees that it actually suffices that M is a transitive \\in-model of a certain finite collection of axioms \\ZF such that \\omega_1 \\subseteq M.\n\nThe result is the best possible with respect to the analytical hierarchy, since the statement\\exists \\alpha \\; [\\alpha \\not\\in L]\n\nis \\Sigma^1_3, but cannot be absolute for M = L.\n\nShoenfield’s absoluteness theorem also holds for sentences rather than predicates, with a similar proof. This means a \\Sigma^1_2 statement is true in L if and only if it holds in V. Many results of classical analysis are \\Sigma^1_2 statements. The Shoenfield absoluteness theorem says that if they can be established under \\VL, they can be established in \\ZF alone.\n\nOn the negative side, as we will soon see, Shoenfield absoluteness also puts strong limits on the use of forcing to establish independence results in analysis.","type":"content","url":"/shoenfield#absoluteness-of-sigma-1-2-relations","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"The Structure of Borel Sets"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/structureborel","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"The Structure of Borel Sets"},"content":"In this chapter, we further investigate the structure of Borel sets.

It is possible to do this, but it requires a careful development of what it means to take effective unions along countable ordinals. We will return to it later.\n\nLooking further ahead, one can show that the set of all Borel codes is not Borel (exercise -- use a diagonalization argument as in the proof of \n\nTheorem 1). At the heart of this lies the fact that we cannot, in a Borel way, describe whether an arbitrary tree over \\Nat is well-founded or not. This will soon be a central topic when we turn our investigation to analytic and co-analytic sets. This general proof of existence of universal sets does not use Borel codes, since those were defined only for Borel sets of finite order. The proof of {prf:ref}`prop-universal-general` provides an idea how we could extend the definition of a code to transfinite orders: Take unions of codes along a cofinal sequence. However, we would like to this in an effective way, and it is not clear how to do this for infinite ordinals in general. \n\nWe will later return to this question, when we introduce computable ordinals}.\n ","type":"content","url":"/structureborel#borel-sets-of-transfinite-order","position":11},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Subspaces of Polish Spaces"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/subsets-polish","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Subspaces of Polish Spaces"},"content":"Closed subsets of Polish spaces (with the subspace topology) are Polish (\n\nProposition 1).\n\nWhat about open subsets like (0,1) \\subset \\Real?

It turns out we can change the topology so that a given Borel set becomes clopen while inducing the same family of Borel sets overall.\n\nWe start with closed sets.\n\nIf X is a Polish space with topology \\mathcal{O}, and F \\subseteq X is closed, then there exists a finer topology \\mathcal{O}' \\supseteq \\mathcal{O} such that \\mathcal{O} and \\mathcal{O}' give rise to the same class of Borel sets in X, and F is clopen with respect to \\mathcal{O}'.\n\nBy \n\nProposition 1 and \n\nProposition 1, respectively, F and X \\setminus F are Polish spaces with compatible metrics d_F and d_{X\\setminus F},  respectively. Wlog d_F, d_{X\\setminus F} < 1. We form the disjoint union of the spaces F and X \\setminus F: This is the set X = F \\,\\sqcup\\, X \\setminus F with the following topology, \\mathcal{O}'. U \\subseteq F \\,\\sqcup\\, X \\setminus F is in \\mathcal{O}' if and only if U \\cap F is open (in F) and  U \\cap X\\setminus F is open (in X\\setminus F).\n\nThe disjoint union is Polish, as witnessed by the following metric.d_\\sqcup(x,y) =  \n    \\begin{cases}\n            d_F(x,y) &\\text{if } x,y \\in F, \\\\\n            d_{X\\setminus F}(x,y) &\\text{if } x,y \\in X\\setminus F, \\\\\n            \\;  2  &\\text{otherwise}.\n    \\end{cases}\n\nIt is straightforward to check that d is compatible with \\mathcal{O}'. Furthermore, let (x_n) be Cauchy in (X,d_\\sqcup). Then the x_n are completely in F or in X\\setminus F from some point on, and hence (x_n) converges.\n\nUnder the disjoint union topology, F is is clopen. Moreover, an open set in this topology is a disjoint union of an open set in X\\setminus F, which also open the original topology \\mathcal{O}, and an intersection of an open set from \\mathcal{O} with F. Such sets are Borel in (X,\\mathcal{O}), hence (X,\\mathcal{O}) and (X,\\mathcal{O}') have the same Borel sets.\n\nLet X be a Polish space with topology \\mathcal{O}, and suppose B \\subseteq X is Borel. Then there exists\na finer Polish topology \\mathcal{O}' \\supseteq \\mathcal{O} such that \\mathcal{O} and \\mathcal{O}' give rise to the same class of Borel sets in X, and B is clopen with respect to \\mathcal{O}'.\n\nLet \\mathcal{S} be the family of all subsets A of X for which a finer topology exists that has the same Borel sets as \\mathcal{O} and in which A is clopen.\n\nWe will show that \\mathcal{S} is a σ-algebra, which by the previous Lemma contains the closed sets. Hence \\mathcal{S} must contain all Borel sets, and we are done.\n\n\\mathcal{S} is clearly closed under complements, since the complement of a clopen set is clopen in any topology.\n\nSo assume now that \\{A_n\\} is a countable family of sets in \\mathcal{S}. Let \\mathcal{O}_n be a topology on X that makes A_n clopen and does not introduce new Borel sets.\n\nLet \\mathcal{O}_\\infty be the topology generated by \\bigcup_n \\mathcal{O}_n. Then \\bigcup_n A_n is open in (X, \\mathcal{O}_\\infty), and we can apply \n\nLemma 2. For this to work, however, we have to show that (X, \\mathcal{O}_\\infty) is Polish and does not introduce any new Borel sets.\n\nWe know that the product space \\prod (X,\\mathcal{O}_n) is Polish. Consider the mapping \\phi: X \\to \\prod_n Xx \\mapsto (x,x,x, \\dots).\n\nObserve that ϕ is a continuous mapping between (X,\\mathcal{O}_{\\infty}) and \\prod_n X.  The preimage of a basic open set U_1 \\times U_2 \\times \\cdots \\times U_n \\times X \\times X \\times \\cdots under ϕ is just the intersection of the U_i. Furthermore, ϕ is clearly one-to-one, and the inverse mapping between \\phi(X) and X is continuous, too.\n\nIf we can show that \\phi(X) is closed in \\prod_n X, we know it is Polish as a closed subset of a Polish space, and since (X,\\mathcal{O}_\\infty) is homeomorphic to \\phi(X), we can conclude it is Polish.\n\nTo see that \\phi(X) is closed in \\prod_n X, let (y_1,y_2,y_3, \\dots) \\in \\Co{\\phi(X)}. Then there exist i < j such that y_i \\neq y_j. Since (X, \\mathcal{O}) is Polish, we can pick U,V open, disjoint such that y_i \\in U, y_j \\in V. Since each \\mathcal{O}_n refines \\mathcal{O}, U is open in \\mathcal{O}_i, and V is open in \\mathcal{O}_j. Therefore,X_1 \\times X_2 \\times \\cdots \\times  X_{i-1} \\times U \\times X_{i+1} \\times \\cdots \\times X_{j_1} \\times V \\times X_{j+1} \\times X_{j+2} \\times \\cdots\n\nwhere X_k = X for k \\neq i,j, is an open neighborhood of (y_1,y_2,y_3, \\dots) completely contained in \\Co{\\phi(X)}.\n\nFinally, too see that the Borel sets of (X, \\mathcal{O}_\\infty) are the same as the ones of (X,\\mathcal{O}), for each n, let \\{U^{(n)}_i\\}_{i \\in \\Nat} be a basis for \\mathcal{O}_n. By assumption, all sets in \\mathcal{O}_n are Borel sets of (X, \\mathcal{O}). The set \\{U^{(n)}_i\\}_{i,n \\in \\Nat} is a subbasis for \\mathcal{O}_\\infty. This means that any open set in (X, \\mathcal{O}_\\infty) is a countable union of finite intersections of the U^{(n)}_i. Since every U^{(n)}_i is Borel in (X, \\mathcal{O}), this means that any open set in \\mathcal{O}_\\infty is Borel in (X, \\mathcal{O}). Since the Borel sets are closed under complementation and countable unions, this in turn implies that every Borel set of (X, \\mathcal{O}_\\infty) is already Borel in (X, \\mathcal{O}).\n\nPerfect subset property for Borel sets; Alexandroff, Hausdorff\n\nIn a Polish space, every uncountable Borel set has a perfect subset.\n\nLet (X,\\mathcal{O}) be Polish, and assume B \\subseteq X is Borel. We can choose a finer topology \\mathcal{O}' \\supseteq \\mathcal{O} so that B becomes clopen, but the Borel sets stay the same. By \n\nTheorem 1, B is Polish with respect to the subspace topology \\mathcal{O}'|_B\n\nSuppose B is uncountable. By \n\nTheorem 1 there exists a continuous injection f from \\Cant (with respect to the standard topology) into (B,\\mathcal{O}'|_B).\n\nSince \\mathcal{O}' is finer than \\mathcal{O}, f is continuous with respect to \\mathcal{O}, too. Since \\Cant is compact, f(\\Cant) is closed with respect to \\mathcal{O}. Finally, f(\\Cant) has no isolated points with respect to \\mathcal{O}', which then also holds for the coarser topology \\mathcal{O}.\n\nTherefore, B has a perfect subset.","type":"content","url":"/subsets-polish#borel-set-as-clopen-sets","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Trees"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/trees","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Trees"},"content":"Let A be a set.
