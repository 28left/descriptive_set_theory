# Cardinals

Cardinal numbers capture the notion of the **cardinality** of a set. We measure the cardinality of a set relative to other sets by saying sets $a,b$ have the **same cardinality** if there exists a bijection between them.

We use the following notation:
\begin{align*}
a \sim b \quad & : \Leftrightarrow \quad \text{ there exists a bijection } a \leftrightarrow b \\
a \preceq b \quad & : \Leftrightarrow \quad \text{ there exists an injection } a \hookrightarrow b \\
a \prec b \quad & : \Leftrightarrow \quad a \preceq b \; \wedge \; a \nsim b
\end{align*}

It is straightforward to show $\sim$ is an equivalence relation and that $\preceq$ is transitive. $\preceq$ is obviously also reflexive, but if we mod out by $\sim$, do we get a partial order? In other words, do we have antisymmetry in the form
$$
a \prec b \; \wedge \; b \preceq a \quad \overset{?}{\Rightarrow} \quad a \sim b.
$$
This follows pretty easily if we use the Axiom of Choice (in form of the well-ordering principle $\WO$), but it is one of the few fundamental results in the theory of cardinality one can prove without using Choice.

```{danger} Cantor-Schröder-Bernstein theorem
:icon: false

Let $a$ and $b$ be sets. If there is an injection from $a$ to $b$ and an injection from $b$ to $a$, then there exists a bijection between $a$ and $b$.
```


Can every set be well-ordered? This property is equivalent to the **Axiom of Choice** and therefore has a somewhat controversial ontological status among mathematicians.

A **choice function** for a set $X$ is a function $f$ that assigns every set $Y \in X$ an element $y \in Y$.  


```{note} Axiom of Choice ($\AC$)
:icon: false

**(AC)** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every set $X$ of non-empty sets has a choice function.
```
The Axiom of Choice allows for enumerating a (non-empty) set $A$ by using  a choice function for all non-empty subsets of $A$. If the set of elements of $A$ not yet enumerated is non-empty, the choice function applied to this set will give us the next element to be enumerated (thereby well-ordering $A$). On the other hand, if $A$ is well-ordered, we can obtain a choice function by mapping a non-empty subset of $A$ to its least element under the well-ordering. 

It follows that the Axiom of Choice is equivalent to Zermelo's Well-Ordering Principle:

```{note} Well-Ordering Principle ($\WO$)
:icon: false

Every set can be well-ordered
```

Besides $\WO$, $\AC$ has applications in pretty much any branch of mathematics, with many equivalent principles (such as *Zorn's Lemma*, every vector space has a basis, Tychonoff's theorem), but also some strange consequences (such as the [Banach–Tarski paradox](wiki:Banach–Tarski_paradox)).


The foundational issue with the Axiom of Choice lies primarily in the fact that it postulates the existence of a function without any giving any hint at how such a function might be defined. For some sets (e.g., the rationals) we can explicitly describe a well-ordering (by identifying $\Q$ with a subset of $\Z\times \Nat$ and then well-ordering that). But $\AC$ also guarantees a well-order of the reals, and if you try to 'write down' such a well-order, you will quickly run into difficulties.

```

We will need the Axiom of Choice in many places. In the next section, we will use it to develop the theory of cardinal numbers. Some axioms that are considered in descriptive set theory (such as the **Axiom of Determinacy**, AD) contradict $\AC$. It is therefore important to keep track where exactly we use the Choice.

For some applications, it suffices to use weaker forms of $\AC$.

```{note} Axiom of Countable Choice ($\AC_\omega$)
:icon: false

$$ 
\forall n \in \N \; A_n \ne \emptyset \quad \Rightarrow \quad  \exists f \; \forall n \in \omega \;  f(n) \in A_n
$$
```

```{note} Axiom of Dependent Choice ($\DC$)
:icon: false

If $R$ is a binary relation on a set $A$, $a_0 \in A$, and $\forall x \in A \exists y \in A \; xRy$, then 
$$
\exists f \; \left [ f: \N  \longrightarrow A  \; \wedge  \; f(0) = a_0  \; \wedge  \;\forall n \in \N  \; f(n) R f(n+1) \right ]
$$
```

```{prf:proposition}
:nonumber: true

$\AC$ implies $\DC$ and $\DC$ implies $\AC_\omega$.
```

Both implications are strict, in a way we will make precise later.

The axiom $\AC_{\omega}$ is sufficient to prove, for example, the following:
- Every infinite set contains a countably infinite subset.
- A countable union of countable sets is countable.

$\DC$ and $\AC_\omega$ therefore play an important role in the foundations of analysis and measure theory.
