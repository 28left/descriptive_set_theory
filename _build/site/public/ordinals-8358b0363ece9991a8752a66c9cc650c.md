# Ordinals

It will be important for us to extend the usual counting process beyond the natural numbers. To give an example, let us return for a moment to perfect subsets of the reals. To show that every uncountable closed subset of $\mathbb{R}$ contains a perfect subset, we considered the *condensation points* of the set. There is another, more gradual way, to arrive at a perfect subset. When Cantor studied convergence of Fourier series, he introduced the **derivative** of a set: 
$$
A' = \{ x \in A \colon x \text{ is a limit point of } A\}
$$
We can iterate the derivative and consider $A^\prime, A^{\prime\prime}, A^{\prime\prime\prime}, \dots$. This yields a descending sequence of sets
$$
A^\prime \supseteq  A^{\prime\prime} \supseteq A^{\prime\prime\prime} \supseteq \dots \supseteq A^{(n)} \supseteq \dots
$$

```{exercise} 
:nonumber: true

Find a set $A$ such that for all $n$, $A^{(n)} \supsetneq A^{(n+1)}$.
```
As the sequence is nested, we can take a “limit”:
$$
A^{\infty} = \bigcap_n A^{(n)}
$$
But the process does not necessarily stop here. $A^\infty$ may have isolated points again, so that $A^\infty \supsetneq (A^\infty)^\prime$. 

```{exercise}
:nonumber: true

Find a set $A$ such that $A^\infty \supsetneq (A^\infty)^\prime$.
```
Let us introduce $\omega$ as a new number to be used in place of $\infty$ above. We can continue the counting process:
$$
1,2,3, \dots, \omega, \omega+1, \omega+2, \dots, \omega + \omega, \omega + \omega +1, \dots, \omega + \omega + \omega, \dots, \omega\cdot \omega, \dots
$$

We can then define, for example,
$A^{\omega+1} := (A^{\omega})'$. As intuitively clear from above, the new transfinite numbers come with a natural ordering, so we can also put $A^{\omega+\omega} := \bigcap_{\alpha < \omega+\omega} A^{\alpha}$

Another way to count into the transfinite is to reorder the natural numbers and first enumerate all powers of two, followed by all powers of three and so on:
\begin{gather*}
	1, 2, 4, 8, \ldots 3, 9, 27, \ldots 5, 25, 125, \ldots
\end{gather*}
This still leaves an infinite reservoir of numbers like $0, 6, 10, \dots$. 

A number of questions arises: 
- Can this process continued indefinitely?
- Is there a *unifying* principle behind the various ways to count into the transfinite?
- Can we define operations like $+$ and $\cdot$ on these infinite numbers independent of the way we represent these numbers, and without leading to contradictions?

These questions can be addressed by developing the theory of *ordinal numbers* via the concept of a *well-founded order*.



## Orders and well-orders

```{prf:definition}
:nonumber: true

A (**reflexive** or **non-strict**) **partial order** on a set $A$ is a binary relation $\leq$ on $A$ such that for all $a,b,c \in A$,
-  $a\leq a$ &emsp; (reflexive)
-  $a \leq b \; \wedge \; b \leq a \quad \Rightarrow \quad a = b$ &emsp; (anti-symmetric)
 
-  $a \leq b \; \wedge \; b \leq c \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \leq c$ &emsp; (transitive).

A **linear** (or **total**) **order** additionally satisfies for all $a,b \in A$,
-  $a \leq b \; \vee \; b \leq a$  &emsp; (connected).
```

With any reflexive partial order $\leq$ we can associate an *irreflexive* one by letting
$$a < b \quad :\iff \quad a \leq b \; \wedge \; a \neq b.$$
Likewise, we can obtain a reflexive order from an irreflexive one by defining
$$a \leq b \quad :\iff \quad a < b \; \vee \; a = b.$$
In light of this, we will usually just speak of partial or linear orders, without further specifying whether it is reflexive or irreflexive.

```{prf:example}
:nonumber: true

- The usual orders on $\mathbb{Z}$, $\mathbb{Q}$, and $\mathbb{R}$ are linear orders.
- The relation
$$
f \leq g \quad : \iff \quad \forall x \in \mathbb{R} \;\; f(x) \leq g(x)
$$
is a partial order on real valued functions on $\mathbb{R}$ but not a linear order.
- The subset relation $\subseteq$ is a partial order on the power set of any set $A$, but it is a linear order only when $A = \emptyset$. 
```

We can enumerate the natural numbers one after another, but for the other standard ordered number domains this is not possible: We cannot find a place to begin counting (as in the case of $\mathbb{Z}$) or there is no "next bigger" element (as in the case of $\mathbb{Q}$ or $\mathbb{R}$). 


To enumerate these domains in the form $\{a_0, a_1,\ldots, a_n, a_{n+1}, \ldots \}$ we have to reorder them in a way that
- we can start with a smallest element,

and once we have a arrived at an element $a$, 
- we know with which element we continue the enumeration (i.e. there is an *immediate successor* to $a$),
- we can continue the enumeration even if we have already enumerated infinitely many elements before $a$ (but elements of the domain still remain). 

These requirements can be combined into a single property: every non-empty subset (i.e. the elements not enumerated yet) has a least element (to be enumerated next).

```{prf:definition}
:nonumber: true

A linear order $(A,<)$ is a **well-order** if 
$$
\forall Z \; (\emptyset \ne Z \subseteq A \; \Rightarrow \; \exists x \in Z \; \forall y \in Z \;  x \leq y)
$$
```

Orders themselves can be compared using *embeddings*.

```{prf:definition}
:nonumber: true

An **embedding** of a partial order $(A,<_A)$ into another partial order $(B,<_B)$ is a mapping $f:A \to B$ such that for all $x,y \in A$
$$
x <_A y \quad \iff \quad f(x) <_B f(y).

Two orders are **isomorphic** if there exists a bijective embedding of one into the other.
```

Of course every order is isomorphic to itself (*automorphic*) via the identity. But many orders allow automorphisms other than the identity (e.g. $\mathbb{Z}$ with $z \mapsto z+1$), or are isomorphic to a proper subset (for example, $\mathbb{R}$ and $(0,1)$). As we will see, well-orders are very rigid in this regard.

We start with a simple observation.

```{prf:proposition}

Let $(A,<)$ be a well-order and assume $f:A \to A$ is a self-embedding. Then for all $x \in A$, $x \leq f(x)$.
```
```{prf:proof}
:class: dropdown
:nonumber: true

If the set $\{x \in A \colon f(x) < x\}$ is non-empty, it has a minimal element $z$. But since $f$ is increasing, this would imply $f(f(z)) < f(z)$, contradicting the minimality of $z$. 
```

We immediately obtain

```{prf:corollary}
:nonumber: true

The only automorphism of a well-order is the identity.
```

An **initial segment** of an order $(A,<)$ is given by all elements that are smaller than a given element $b$. We denote this initial segment by $A\mid_b$. 

```{prf:corollary}
:nonumber: true

No well-order is isomorphic to an initial segment of itself.
```

```{prf:proof}
:class: dropdown
:nonumber: true

Suppose $f: A \to A\mid_b$ is an isomorphism. Then $\operatorname{ran}(f) = A\mid_b$ and $f(x) < b$ for all $x \in A$. In particular, $f(b) < b$, contradicting Lemma 
```

## Ordinal numbers

*Cantor* defined ordinal numbers (or ordinals) as **isomorphism classes of well-orders**. Later, *von Neumann* suggested a system of representatives particularly suitable for set theoretic considerations. The idea is to define the order $<$ through the $\in$-relation on a set. For example, 
$$
\{ \emptyset, \{\emptyset\}, \{\emptyset, \{\emptyset\}\}\}
$$ 
represents a $3$-element well-order. 

We will impose some conditions on the sets we allow as ordinals. Given a set $A$, we use $\in_A$ to denote the $\in$-relation *on* $A$:
$$
\in_A = \{ (x,y) \colon x,y \in A \; \wedge \; x \in y \}
$$

```{prf:definition}
:label: def-transitive
A set $A$ is **transitive** if 
\begin{equation*} \tag{trans}
    \forall x \in A \; \; x \subseteq A
\end{equation*}
```
```{margin}
**Caution!**
Being transitive does *not* mean the $\in$ relation is transitive on the set. (Counterexample?)
```

In other words, transitive sets cannot "hide" elements in subsets.

```{prf:definition}
:label: def-ordinal

A set $A$ is an **ordinal** if it is transitive and well-ordered by $\in_A$
```
It is customary to use *lower case Greek letters* $\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \dots$ to denote ordinals.

If we exclude certain pathological sets from the beginning, we can further simplify this definition.

```{prf:definition}
:nonumber: true

A set $A$ is **well-founded** if every non-empty subset has a $\in$-minimal element:

$$\forall B \subseteq A \; (B \ne \emptyset \; \Rightarrow \; \exists y \in B \;  \forall z \in B \; \; z \not \in y)$$
```

Sets which contain themselves ($A \in A$) are not well-founded$-$ $\{A\}$ would be a subset without a $\in$-minimal element. Similarly, well-founded sets cannot have cycles like $a \in b \in c \in a$. 

```{prf:proposition}
:label: pro-ordinal-linear-order

Assume every set is well-founded. A set $\alpha$ is an **ordinal** if and only if it is transitive and linearly ordered by $\in_\alpha$.
```

```{exercise} 
:class: tip
:nonumber: true

Prove [](#pro-ordinal-linear-order). 
```

If we write out the formulas in full, we see {prf:ref}`def-ordinal` is much simpler than the original one. Most notably, in {prf:ref}`def-ordinal` we only use only **bounded quantifiers** (of the form $\forall y \in a$), whereas in the original form we have to quantify over arbitrary subsets of $a$. This is an important difference whose impact will become clear later on.

We can now develop the theory of ordinals based on this definition. 

```{prf:proposition}
:label: pro-ordinal-elements-are-ordinals
Any element of an ordinal is an ordinal.
```

```{prf:proof}
:nonumber: true
:class: dropdown

Any subset of a linear order is again a linear order under the induced order relation. It remains to show that $(b, \in_b)$ is transitive. Let $\alpha$ be an ordinal, and assume $b \in \alpha$. Let $x \in c \in b$. We claim $x \in b$. Since $\alpha$ is transitive, $b \subseteq \alpha$ and hence $c \in \alpha$. By transitivity of $\alpha$ again, $c \in \alpha$. Thus $x,b \in \alpha$, and since $\in_\alpha$ linearly orders $\alpha$, we must have
$$
x \in b \; \vee \; x = b \; \vee \; b \in x.
$$
If $x = b$, we get $b \in c \in b$, contradicting well-foundedness. Similar for $b \in x$. Therefore, $x \in b$.
```

## The well-ordering of ordinals

@pro-ordinal-elements-are-ordinals suggests we can order ordinals by letting
$$
\alpha < \beta \; :\iff \; \alpha \in \beta.
$$
By @pro-ordinal-elements-are-ordinals, an ordinal then contains precisely the ordinals smaller than it:
$$
\alpha = \{ \beta : \beta < \alpha \}.
$$

$\in$ defines a partial order on all ordinals:
As all sets are well-founded, irreflexivity holds, and since ordinals are transitive sets, $<$ is a transitive relation.

```{prf:proposition}

For any ordinals $\alpha, \beta$,
$$
\alpha < \beta \; \iff \; \alpha \subset \beta.
$$
```
```{prf:proof}
:nonumber: true
:class: dropdown

The $\Rightarrow$ direction follows directly from the transitivity of ordinals.
For $\Leftarrow$, we show something more general, namely that any transitive proper subset of an ordinal is itself an ordinal and is an element of the superset ordinal:
$$
\Op{trans}(a) \; \wedge \; a \subset \beta \quad \Rightarrow \quad \Op{Ord}(a) \; \wedge \; a \in \beta.
$$
If $a \subset \beta$, $a$ is linearly ordered by $\in$ (as a subset of $\beta$). Further, if $a$ is transitive, $a$ is an ordinal. 

It remains to show $a \in \beta$. Since $a$ is a proper subset of $\beta$, by well-foundedness there exists a $\in$-minimal element of $\gamma \in \beta \setminus a$. We claim $a = \gamma$. By $\in$-minimality of $\gamma$, every element of $\gamma$ cannot be in $\beta\setminus a$ and therefore has to be in $a$. Hence $\gamma \subseteq a$. On the other hand, if $x \in a$, then, by assumption $x \in \beta$, and since $\in$ linearly orders $\beta$, 
$$
x \in \gamma \; \vee \; x = \gamma \; vee \; \gamma \in x.
$$
The latter two are impossible due to $\gamma \notin a$. Hence $x \in \gamma$ and therefore $a \subseteq \gamma$, yielding $a =\gamma$.
```

We can now deduce some basic facts about the structure of ordinals:

- $0 = \emptyset$ is the *smallest ordinal*.

- Every ordinal $\alpha$ has an **immediate successor** under the ordering $<$: 
$$\xi' =  \xi+1 = \xi \cup \{\xi\}.$$
Clearly $\xi < \xi+1

- The *finite ordinals* are exactly the natural numbers:

0 = \emptyset, \quad 1 = 0 + 1 = \emptyset \cup \{\emptyset\} = \{\emptyset\}, \quad 2 = 1+1 = \{\emptyset, \{\emptyset\} \}, \dots
$$   

- By the **axiom of Infinity**, the **set of all finite ordinals** exists. It is transitive, linearly ordered by $\in$ and thus an ordinal itself: $\omega$ the first infinite ordinal and the first **limit ordinal**:

$$
    \omega \neq 0 \: \wedge \: \forall \xi < \omega \; (\xi+1 < \omega).
$$

- Every *set* of ordinals $a$ has a **supremum** $\sup a = \bigcup_{\xi \in a} \xi$ that is itself an ordinal, the least ordinal at least as large as all ordinals in $a$.

- Every well-ordering $(b,<)$ on a set is order-isomorphic to a unique ordinal, the **well-order type** of $(b,<)$

- The $\in$-relation is a well-ordering on the class of all ordinals.

- The ordinals $\mathbf{Ord}$ form a proper class (Burali-Forti antinomy).
