# Ordinal numbers

It will be important for us to extend the usual counting process beyond the natural numbers. To give an example, let us return for a moment to perfect subsets of the reals. To show that every uncountable closed subset of $\mathbb{R}$ contains a perfect subset, we considered the *condensation points* of the set. There is another, more gradual way, to arrive at a perfect subset. When Cantor studied convergence of Fourier series, he introduced the **derivative** of a set: 
$$
A' = \{ x \in A \colon x \text{ is a limit point of } A\}
$$
We can iterate the derivative and consider $A^\prime, A^{\prime\prime}, A^{\prime\prime\prime}, \dots$. This yields a descending sequence of sets
$$
A^\prime \supseteq  A^{\prime\prime} \supseteq A^{\prime\prime\prime} \supseteq \dots \supseteq A^{(n)} \supseteq \dots
$$

```{exercise} 
:nonumber: true

Find a set $A$ such that for all $n$, $A^{(n)} \supsetneq A^{(n+1)}$.
```
As the sequence is nested, we can take a “limit”:
$$
A^{\infty} = \bigcap_n A^{(n)}
$$
But the process does not necessarily stop here. $A^\infty$ may have isolated points again, so that $A^\infty \supsetneq (A^\infty)^\prime$.
