One does not address metamathematical issues at all, while the other seems a bit disconnected from the exciting new developments at the intersection of set theory, dynamical systems, and operator algebras. These notes attempt to offer a 

I also wanted to teach descriptive set theory and axiomatic set theory in one semester, so I
